            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>Every year, thousands of teenagers find themselves without a home, without support, and without hope. <strong>Hope for Teens</strong> was founded to change that.  
               Our mission is simple: connect orphaned teens with loving foster families who can provide stability, education, and emotional support.</p>
            <p>We work with local organizations, social workers, and dedicated volunteers to ensure every teen has the opportunity to thrive. Through our network,  
               we have successfully placed dozens of teenagers in safe and caring homes. But the work is far from over, and we need your help.</p>
